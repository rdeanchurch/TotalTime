# TotalTime
Attempt to create a lua function script to keep track of the total on time of the transmitter(tx).
Poasible uses:
  Total time tx is on.
  Time since last re-chargeing the tx.
  could expand to log total time on each model.
  
  I expect it to be a Function script that is started with a global function.
